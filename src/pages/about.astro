    bio: 'My interest in medicine developed when I was very young. In fifth grade health class I watched the NOVA program "Miracle of Life" and was amazed by the process of human development, from conception to birth. From that moment I knew I wanted to be a physician, taking care of women and participating in the miracle of human life. Being a women\'s healthcare provider is both an honor and a privilege which I greatly enjoy. Our getting to know each other is an important part of providing your complete obstetrical and gynecological care. My getting to know you goes well beyond learning your health history to truly understanding your feelings and concerns as we discuss very sensitive, personal issues. Your getting to know me will help you feel comfortable sharing your concerns. I want you to be confident in knowing that you will receive personalized care from someone you can trust. I enjoy traveling, dining, and spending time with my three children. I appreciate people from various cultures and backgrounds. I love reading a good mystery novel and I especially love to cook, but I don\'t really like having to clean up afterward.',
