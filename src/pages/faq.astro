    questions: [
      {
        question: 'When can I expect to hear from the surgery scheduler?',
        answer: 'Our surgery scheduler will send you a portal message and attempt to call you to schedule surgery based on the order of when your request was received, unless specifically ordered on an emergent basis. You should get your portal message 5-7 business days from when the scheduler receives your surgery order request from your provider. Please note that not all surgery order requests are processed by your provider on the same day as your appointment.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What if I am not called within 5-7 business days?',
        answer: 'If you have not been contacted by our surgery scheduler, please feel free to contact the office to inquire as to your surgery request. Unfortunately, errors do occasionally occur and perhaps your request has not been sent yet. There are also times that your provider will wait to send through a surgery order request to give you time to think about your options before making a decision. In that instance, once we hear from you as to which surgery you would like to pursue, a message is then sent to your provider detailing your decision and they will then send a surgery order request to the scheduler.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will a surgery date be automatically picked for me?',
        answer: 'Once a surgery order request has been received, our surgery scheduler will look for the first available surgery date with your provider. At that point, the surgery scheduler will then contact you to make sure this date will work for your schedule as well. If there is a conflict with the date the scheduler has offered, while she is on the phone with you, she will determine the next available surgery date(s) until a date is agreed upon. We do have limited surgical availability due to hospital blocks, your exact day may not be available. Once we have your date we must obtain auth for the date you picked PRIOR to scheduling with the hospital. This can take up 10-14 business days to get a response on approval from insurance.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How much will the surgery cost me?',
        answer: 'Once your surgery has been scheduled, the surgery scheduler will send a Healthcare Service Estimate to your portal. This will provide the PROVIDERS estimated cost, not the hospital/facility (unless being done in the office). We will contact your insurance company to verify eligibility and benefits as well as to inquire as to what your out of pocket and deductible costs will be. At this time we will also apply for authorizations if needed.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How much time off will I need after surgery?',
        answer: 'Your recovery time is based on the procedure performed and what your specific job duties entail. If there are questions regarding how much time off you will need, you can discuss this with your provider at your preoperative appointment.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will I need FMLA paperwork or Short-Term Disability paperwork completed?',
        answer: 'You will need to check with your employer to verify if you are eligible for FMLA/Short term disability for your upcoming surgery. If these forms need to be completed, please turn them into our office as soon as you can, as it can take up to 7-10 business days to complete them. These forms are also completed based on the order of when your forms were received. You can turn your forms in to the receptionist at your provider\'s office or you can fax them into the office. Please remember that your time off is based on the procedure performed and what your specific job duties entail. A small fee of $25.00 may apply.'
